# Word Filtering & Verify Files

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/sbrw-settings.PNG)

### Disable Word Filtering on Game Chat

Checking this option will delete profwords in the Game Files. This allows for foul words to be viewed in game, which by default is censored.

### Disable process that validate files

Checking this option will disable validation of files that do match the master server file hashes.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Unchecking this option will enable validation of files that match the master server file hashes. 

_Will slowdown your pc if not powerful enough. Game play will be impacted if you uncheck this beforehand_
{% endhint %}

This is similar to Steam Verify Hash. Where any files that do that match the master file hashes or are corrupted will be re-downloaded.
